# Hakerrank Challenge

Welcome to the **Hakerrank Challenge** repository! 🚀

## About
This repository is dedicated to solving **HackerRank** challenges using **Python** and **SQL**. It is maintained by **Burcu** and **Khawlah**, and we are committed to enhancing our problem-solving skills and deepening our understanding of coding concepts.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Practice and refine our coding skills in Python and SQL.
- Explore different problem-solving techniques.
- Keep track of our progress and revisit solutions for improvement.
- Have fun while tackling interesting challenges!

## Technologies Used
This repository primarily focuses on:
- **Python** 🐍 - for algorithmic and data structure challenges.
- **SQL** 🛢️ - for database-related problems.

## File Naming Convention
Each challenge will have separate solutions for Burcu and Khawlah. To maintain organization, we follow this naming convention:
- **Python Solutions**: `ProblemName_Khawlah.py`, `ProblemName_Burcu.py`
- **SQL Solutions**: `ProblemName_Khawlah.sql`, `ProblemName_Burcu.sql`

This ensures clarity and allows us to compare different problem-solving approaches.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured to keep challenges organized by category.
```
├── Python
│   ├── ProblemName_Khawlah.py
│   ├── ProblemName_Burcu.py
└── SQL
    ├── ProblemName_Khawlah.sql
    ├── ProblemName_Burcu.sql
```

## How We Work
1. We pick a **HackerRank** problem.
2. Each of us writes our own solution.
3. We review each other's code and discuss different approaches.
4. If needed, we refactor and optimize solutions for better performance.

## Progress Tracking
To track our progress, we will maintain a **Solved Challenges Log** where we list problems solved, difficulty levels, and any important notes about the approach used.
